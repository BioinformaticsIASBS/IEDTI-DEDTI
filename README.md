# IEDTI-DEDTI
This article proposes two predictive methods of drug-target interactions. It focuses on three aims. 
-	First, this paper criticizes using inner product-based matrix factorization to predict drug-target interactions (DTIs). Matrix factorization is a linear operation and suffers from some drawbacks. We mention some of these drawbacks, which make matrix factorization incapable of correctly predicting drug-target interaction. We explain that matrix factorization cannot locate more complex and nonlinear relationships among drugs and targets. 

-	The second aim of this research is to provide dense representations of drugs and targets. 
 
-	The final aim of this work is to develop two efficient and accurate computational methods (IEDTI and DEDTI) for DTI prediction. In addition to DTI prediction, IEDTI produces embeddings of drugs and targets to have meaningful representations of the objects and more efficient computation. Both methods utilize the deep neural network to predict DTIs best.
